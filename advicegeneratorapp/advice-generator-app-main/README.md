## My process
I began this process like many of my projects with creating a Mockup of what the project should look like using Figma. This is to continue my growth and understanding of Figma. Once the desgin was duplicated, I did my natural course of making HTML Elements fitting for the projects different sections. Then I added my CSS to visually interpert my Figma mockups. Lastly I did add my API using just a little bit of JavaScript. This shows how I can incorporate my knowledge of JavaScrip and the use of API's within my project. All of my site is responsive using Tailwind Media Query recommendations.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Advice Generator API

### What I learned

This project helped me revisit how to incoorporate API's within my projects. I really enjoyed taking a step back and relearning my process to include an API within my JavaScript. This has motivated me to work with more API projects coming soon.
